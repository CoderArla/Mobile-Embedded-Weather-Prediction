The ipynb files contains the actual implementation of the weather condition prediction models.

The rest of the files are the to be opened and run in 'wokwi' simulator.

The sketch.ino is the main file that contains the implementation of decision tree onto the Arduino Mega simulator.

The simulated hardware fetches data from the virtual sensors, inputs it to the decision tree, which inturn gives out the desired prediction value.
